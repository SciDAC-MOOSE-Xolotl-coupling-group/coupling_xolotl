This folder contains the parameter files needed to reproduce the results present in the 2D coupling paper.
PETSc version:
Xolotl version:
MOOSE version:
Coupling code version:

Physics output: full cases where run at 1800 K up to 1.2e8 s.
*_PFSTANDALONE*: case where only the phase-field part of the code is used
*_NOCNOR*: case where Xolotl only models the diffusion of Xe_1
*_CNOR*: case where Xolotl models the clustering of xenon clusters
*_CR*: care where Xolotl models the clustering and re-solution of xenon clusters

Scaling study: 20 TS where used.
